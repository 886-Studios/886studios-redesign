I figured out that the baby industry was pretty viable to break into since there were lots of independent shops, no large corporations. So then we started doing prototypes, recruiting family and friends to interact with the prototype… I think in some ways product market fit is very mysterious.`,
          `I prefer the term product-user fit because it’s something you can get your hands around. Once you get product-user fit, you can then figure out what market those users belong to. So first, we wanted to know if there were users our product was useful for, and then we went into what market they represent.”`,

You are also trying to find the right employees, partners, vendors, investors, markets.”`,

        answer: [
          `Charles: “I like to build interesting products, I think no matter what I work on it has to be intrinsically interesting. If somebody told me that my company would not be super successful- but I would be able to make games for the rest of my life and get my paycheck, I would still be happy doing it. One of the great things about making games, specifically Guitar Hero, is whenever somebody tells us they played our game, they’re usually smiling when they say it because it was fun to them.`,
          `And it’s very rewarding that we were able to bring that element of joy to their lives. There’s this reward for that which you wouldn’t get for doing something else.`,
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "886: What are elements that make a good or successful game?",
        answer: [
          `Charles: “What makes a game successful is different from what makes it good. I think that success is a completely different story. To build a good game, you need to build a world-class product. To be successful, you need to have a world-class product and a lot of luck.`,
          `When I was at Activision, the CMO once said: ‘we have 12 games at this company that are all pegged to be top 10 this year.’ But when you think about it, the math doesn’t really work out. How can you have 12 top 10 games in a year? What I think you can do is you can always make a good product. For a startup to be successful, they need to be able to make a world-class product. To me, that means top 3 in the industry. In tech, the number 1 and number 2 have a disproportionate market share and will survive.`,
          `Number 3 maybe survives. Everybody else is just waiting to get killed by 1 and 2. You need to be able to have a team that is capable of creating a world-class product in a specific category.`,
          `In our case, we specialized in making a hardware-software company in a time when many people didn’t do that. This was 15-16 years ago where you were either a hardware company or software company, not both. And it wasn’t until Apple came around and did both pretty well that people saw the value of doing both. But when we were doing it, I thought that our software couldn’t even compete with the software in the industry. Same with our hardware.`,
          `But since we were doing both, we were the best since there weren’t many other companies willing to try. And that gave us the shot to build something world-class.`,
          `In the games industry, it’s hard to be a monopoly. Like if you’re building an OS for mobile phones, it’s unlikely you can take down Apple or Android, there’s just no opportunity. But games can come and go, there will always be an opportunity to take down the top. Just like we did- we came out of nowhere to take the best selling game in 2007 and 2008. So for some industries like games, you have the opportunities, and in others you have no chance at all.`,
          `But what I like to emphasize over and over is that you have to build a great product. And whether or not it will be successful or not depends on luck. You need to find the right investors, customers, timing. If you can’t build a world-class product you have little chance at being successful.”`,
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "886: How do entrepreneurs overcome mental barriers, particularly in regards to funding?",
        answer: [
          `Charles: “Speaking from my experience with Guitar Hero, we were somewhat fortunate in regards to funding because we started in a time where VCs were just not looking to fund anything. This was during the Dotcom bust, and they weren’t investing in any startups. Because of that, it was easy to just give up on looking after 6-8 months, since nobody was ever going to invest in anything and we didn’t want to waste our time.`,
          `So we were able to build our company focusing specifically on what people would buy and how we would make money. Because of that we cut out a lot of useless stuff that we would have done and lost us money. That’s why I feel when a lot of startups raise money, it kind of clouds that clarity of what they need to do.`,
          `When we started, we did a lot of things that were not that innovative or exciting. When we started, we were selling dance pads for Dance Dance Revolution. People would tell us that there was no future in dance pads. And they were right, we weren’t stupid- but it made us money and helped to keep the company going. And while we’re selling we’re also learning things which can help us build the next product, then the next. Which eventually allowed us to build our own dance game and then Guitar Hero.`,
          `But when we started out our business wasn’t that flashy. We didn’t have the funding to build the things we thought people might want, so we had to get it right to keep the company going.`,
          `Silicon Valley has convinced the world that the way you run a startup is starting with an idea, then getting seed funding, then building something, then funding and scaling through VCs. But many people forget that it’s possible to build something on their own. I’ve found that a lot of entrepreneurs break rules in their industries- except when it comes to funding.`,
          `I always find it funny that they can find ways around market problems and product problems, but when it comes to funding, they all think the same which is to go to VCs for money.”`,

        question: "886: What are products or features of products that excite you?",
        answer: [
          `Charles: “A lot of what I like is building hardware. I’m on the board of a couple companies and one of the companies that fascinated me was working with Nintendo to create Mario Kart Live. It was an AR product, essentially the Mario Kart game but there was a physical drone with a camera attached that you played through. You could use your physical location and create your own race track and play Mario Kart.`,
          `It was probably the most sophisticated AR product that has been built to date, and I always think those are pretty interesting. AR isn’t too popular right now but it was interesting to see how they built it to craft a Mario Kart experience.”`,
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "886: How do you feel when all new startups are trying to implement the new technologies like web3, AI?",
        answer: [
          `Charles: “Many years ago there were two startups I was advising. One company was building a FitBit/health tracking tool for dogs that predicts potential health complications. When they went to the customers like veterinarians, they weren’t super excited because it would take years to collect all the data from the dogs to train their AI. It wasn’t useful to the customers yet, so they were told to come back when they had the technology.`,
          `But when the company went to VCs, the investors loved it because it involved AI, big data, pet health all that.`,
          `The other startup which was also pet related was taking pet medical records, which were on paper, and digitizing them using OCR to make it more accessible to owners and veterinarians. When they met with their customers, the vets were super excited because it saved them so much time. But the VCs didn’t care for it because they weren’t using interesting technologies. They were using OCR, so what’s to stop another company from competing in their market?`,
          `So for the first company, the customers didn’t really like it but the investors loved it. For the other company, the customers loved it but the investors not so much. And it made me realize that sometimes there’s a big disconnect between what investors want and what the customers want. Right now, AI is super hot to investors and a lot of people are getting funded, but many of these people actually have no idea what customers want.`,
          `I also see a lot of good companies with product-market fit but don’t have the new technologies, so investors aren’t interested.”`,
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "886: How do you see difference in growth between these two companies?",
        answer: [
          `Charles: “I would tell the company that is doing the pet medical records that they probably aren’t going to get that much funding, and need to figure out how to scale properly and naturally. They need to manage their costs, and can’t hire a ton of people. But as long as you are profitable, you will likely grow since people like your product. Later down the line when you have more profits, you can create more products that may be more attractive to investors.`,
          `So I think you can survive in both tracks, but you just need to know the best way to grow your company.”`,
        ],
      },
      {
        question: "886: What is the most difficult decision you had to make for your company?",
        answer: [
          `Charles: “By far the toughest thing that we ever had to do was layoffs. Particularly in 2008 when the economy crashed. It’s a very emotional process because these are the people that you hired, built a company with and you’ve gone through everything with. You’re probably very close since you’ve worked with them a long time and might know their family. And for me, the first time we had to do that in 2008, was really, really difficult.`,
          `We had to call people into meetings and take the time to talk with them about their situations, it was very emotional and personal. I had employees who had financial goals such as purchasing a house and we had to assess what we needed to do. These are some of the things where you think it’s just a business decision but when you know them as humans you know it’s much deeper than that. They had lives and invested their effort in the company and we invested in them.`,
          `So I would say that the hardest decisions are almost always the emotional and personal ones rather than for the business.”`,
        ],
      },

        question: "886: What do you think about starting a company with a friend or relative considering you started a company with your brother?",
        answer: [
          `Charles: “I always start with the positive: we know exactly how each other thinks. Since we’ve known each other our entire lives, we know how each other thinks, we don’t need to guess, which is very helpful. There’s also trust between us, I trust what he’s going to do and he trusts what I’m going to do. The trouble comes from how we behaved with each other. If I was interacting with someone professionally and they said something not so smart, I would respond politely.`,
          `But if it was my brother Kai, I would say ‘that’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.’ And then we would start arguing like we were twelve years old. There’s less formality between us and that sometimes would waste a lot of time when we got into arguments. It became a bit of a problem for business because we learned that when we disagreed, the rest of the company would just freeze since they didn’t want to disagree with either of us.`,
          `And so we had to learn and act more professionally since we realized that it also affects other people, usually negatively.”`,

          `Jameson: “I actually got started by accident. After graduating, I was working in a big company doing management consulting, and I would work on these projects building websites after work with friends.`,
          `My friend actually initiated it - he was creative and said, ‘let’s work on this together.’ This was 1999, so it was the really early stages of the internet, and we had some press take note of our websites, and then some major companies started taking notice said, ‘hey, if you build these websites for us we’ll pay you money.’ We built it, it won a lot of awards, it got even more media attention, we got even more calls, and so we decided to quit and work on this full time.”`,
          `“I started just for fun. When you’re young, you should be doing stuff. So, why did I do that? I had nothing else to do. I guess I could have gone out, clubbing or whatever, but it was more fun building stuff.”`,

        answer: [
          `Jameson: “Well, let’s start with what hasn’t changed. The thing that has never changed is problem solving - the thing you’re creating is working to solve a problem. It’s how everything started back then, and it’s still how things start today. The thing that has changed is that it’s now a lot easier to start a company than it was back then. We used to have to buy servers, manage the servers, change out hard disks, buy electricity, buy data… now it’s much easier.`,
          `So now, if you have an idea, there’s probably someone who’s already doing it. Now, anyone with an idea can start a company. So now, the thing that’s different, good ideas are harder to come by. It’s harder to come by some unique idea. Back then, if you had an okay idea, you could build a company! Now, you really have to find a problem and a really really good solution that no has already thought of. There are two sides: back then, execution was much harder, idea was easy.`,
          `Now, the idea is really hard, and execution is not as hard. In English, we call it signal and noise: there’s a lot more noise now.”`,

          `If you make one bad decision - if you have two features to build and you choose poorly, you could make the wrong choice; or if you spend half of the amount of money you have to hire someone, and that person doesn’t deliver, then you’ve wasted all that money. That’s the difference between entrepreneurs that succeed and don’t succeed: their ability to make decisions, and to make good decisions, and to make decisions quickly and decisively.”`,

Looking at a car, you can’t tell how much horsepower it has, but when you hear the sound of the engine, you can hear ‘oh, this is a powerful engine.’ It’s the same thing with people: when you talk to them, you can tell that they can go far.`,
          `That’s why I bring people to the gym - when you go alone, it’s easy to be like ‘oh I’m so tired and I can’t do it any more.’ But when you go with a coach, with people pushing you to go harder, you realize ‘oh I actually did a lot more than I thought I could.’ I want people to understand that they can do more than they think they can.

I took note of some of her symptoms, and when she passed, I wanted to look for and invest in a company that did diabetes management and chronic disease management. I was on the airplane talking to a longtime friend who was selling his company at the time when the opportunity presented itself. He told me that all four of his grandparents had passed from diabetes.`,
          `Considering he would also be susceptible to diabetes, I said ‘don’t you think you should do anything about it?’ He told me he had been thinking about it, and at that moment I offered to invest in him. I told him that I would put in my own money and find some other funding over the next few weeks if he wanted to run with his idea. He went through and created the company Health2Sync and it grew to be the most successful diabetes control management company in Taiwan and Japan.`,
          `Another problem I solved involves my dad. A while ago he got sick and became hard of hearing, so he got a hearing aid. He hated the hearing aid, and so did I because it worked terribly and every time we wanted to talk we would have to shout. I wanted to find a better solution, so I sat down with him and listed the problems: it was too big, the battery was hard to change, you had to go to the clinic to tune it, etc.`,
          `The next day I took his hearing aid to the lab and took it apart to figure out the design and how it could be changed. I sent out a few emails to people I knew and looking for anyone in Taiwan that was working on a hearing aid. But a key part of this search was that I wanted to find someone that had an incentive to make it work. If they were deaf, then you know that one they will work hard towards solving the problem and two they will understand the problem.`,
          `I found an engineer that was deaf who was working on a hearing aid and I looked at my list of problems to see if this hearing aid hit each one. It did, so I offered to put in my own money and find other funding as well. The company was RelaJet.

        answer: [
          `Tim: “Founders can be good CEOs and founders can be bad CEOs. Sometimes founders will grow to become a good CEO. When you’re a founder, you’re doing everything in the company. When the company eventually grows with many employees and teams, the responsibilities and skillset of a founder changes and shifts towards big picture. For example, when VIA grew and I was starting to manage a large group of people, I noticed that most of what I was doing was resource allocation, budgeting, management.`,
          `It’s very different. Founders can be CEOs and CEOs can be founders, but they’re two different things. Sometimes founders that remain CEO will limit the company’s growth or performance because they simply don’t have the skillset for a high level management role.”`,

          `Tim: “I have a set of personal principles that guide my own life. I set my goals and I try to make sure I adhere to my values in my actions. But when I’m investing I mostly am looking at whether it interests me. Does it itch and do I want to scratch it? Kind of like a mosquito bite. If it doesn’t bother me I don’t give it attention but if it does then I’ll be thinking about it in the shower, the toilet, and it persists and lingers for a period of time before I eventually act.”`,

        question: "886: What would you say are your interests at the moment?",
        answer: [
          `Phil: “I spend my week running the New Taipei Kings. It actually started after the success of P. League+. I saw the success and decided to create my own team to compete in the league so I’m the CEO and run the team. I sign the players, coaches and oversee the sales, marketing, and operations team. I knew nothing about how to build or start a team, but it came naturally to me as it was just like running a business/startup. You figure out what is needed, what is standard for contracts and you run with it.`,
          `I really wanted to do something different with the team, so we are actually the only team in Asia that fully represents the city and don’t have a major corporate sponsor. I don’t think having a corporate sponsor is the right way and I want to build the city/regional pride that makes sports so exciting. I want a team that represents the city and because of that we can do cooler things such as our partnership with Audi and Lululemon.”`,
          `“I also spend a lot of time as an executive advisor in a battery company in Taiwan called Cold Electric that provides battery energy storage for homes, and buildings. I’m a Bitcoin fanatic and have my own mining rigs, and when I learned about the energy consumption of Bitcoin I explored cheaper and greener energy which soon got me into batteries. We’re working towards a more efficient and sustainable future utilizing a decentralized power grid.`,

        question: "886: In your career you have held various roles in the startup industry, what is your favorite/most enjoyable role and why?",
        answer: [
          `Phil: “It’s changed over the different stages of my life. When I was young I enjoyed being an entrepreneur. When I exited to a larger company, I really enjoyed that too. I went from being a corporate venture to angel seed investor to venture capital, and then to starting my own venture capital. I’ve enjoyed all of it, but the most surprising role that I enjoyed that I didn’t think I would enjoy as much as I did is building the New Taipei Kings.`,
          `Everything that I’ve built before has been in the tech space, which has naturally been international and global. It’s fun to feel like a global citizen and connected with other countries. But doing a basketball team based in Taiwan is local. Most people outside probably don’t care that much since it only involves Taiwan and is largely local. And I didn’t think I would really enjoy that since I’ve always been globally minded- maybe too much.`,
          `But I’ve enjoyed it immensely- building something local and seeing how the fans truly care and appreciate what you do for the city. I wouldn’t say it’s the most enjoyable, but definitely the most surprisingly enjoyable role. It’s really how we’ve been engaging with the local community that has been quite different.”`,

        question: "886: Do you have exits that you were a part of which were particularly significant to you in ways more than money?",
        answer: [
          `Phil: “This isn’t necessarily an exit but an event that took my career in a completely different direction. Back in 2014, my family and were living in Hong Kong. This was back when I was working on the Vive, and during this time I was doing demos of the product all around the world and was travelling almost a quarter million miles a year. I remember during this period, I was in Israel in a space that had been given to me by a fund that I had invested in to run demos.`,
          `The GP of that fund came in and told me ‘there’s a special guest here that wants to try out your VR headset today.’ We were fully packed, but I was still able to give her a demo. It turns out, she ran a venture fund in Hong Kong called Horizons Ventures. Long story short, I ended up working for her and became an investor. But what really was amazing was that their office in Hong Kong was just a five minute walk from where I lived.`,
          `And that was really, really what I needed at that time since I was travelling a lot and being so close gave me quality time with my family.”`,

        question: "886: What would you say are some of your personal principles that primarily guide your investing?",
        answer: [
          `Phil: “There’s a lot, but the one that I mainly look for is what I call the ‘persistence mileage.’ At its essence, its basically evaluating how far will this person go before they give up. Sometimes I ask the founder outright. How much pain and suffering are you willing to endure until you give up on this idea? Or are you going to persist no matter what. And you know, it’s not always certain. It’s kind of an intuition, a thought in the back of my mind when they’re pitching.`,
          `You ask them questions and probe them to see how much they’ve thought ahead. Are they an opportunist and take what they can? Are they a mercenary or missionary? Are they in it for the money or do they really believe in what they are saying? I believe all startup entrepreneurs should all be missionaries first. The successful founders are missionaries who hire the mercenaries to develop and scale. I’ve met a few people in their journey where I can tell they’re not gonna give up.`,
          `Like- I would be scared to compete with this type of person. They won’t give up fundraising, opportunities, absolutely nothing in order to execute their vision. They truly believe in what they’re pitching and their vision. Those are the people most likely to be successful.”`,

      {
        question: "886: What would you say is the hardest challenge or period a founder faces when creating a startup for the first time?",
        answer: [
          `Phil: “One of the biggest challenges I see in almost every founder is in confidence or self doubt. When you start a company and 10 people tell you ‘no’ when you are trying to raise money, you still have the ‘yes’ in your mind. But if 50 people tell you ‘no’ then you just might start believing that. For example, Kevin Lin has his story where he had 100 ‘no’s before his first ‘yes’ and that’s really amazing belief and confidence in yourself. I’ve talked with many NBA trainers before.`,
          `When you want to determine the difference between a good and a great shooter it’s not in the technique, practice, or talent. They all have the same training and put in the same amount of work. What separates the great from the good is if they themselves believe they will make the shot. I’ve noticed especially in Taiwan that many founders lack this when they can and should be more confident.`,
          `They have the talent but are hindered by themselves, and they don’t believe that they can move to Silicon Valley and make it. They envision themselves but never actually take the leap and do so.”`,
